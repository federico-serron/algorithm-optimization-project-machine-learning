The dataset consists of four attributes: sepal-width, sepal-length, petal-width and petal-length. These are the attributes of specific types of iris plant. The goal is to predict the class to which these plants belong. There are three classes in the dataset: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.\n","\n","\n","**Library installation**\n","\n","\n","First let's install the Scikit-learn library by entering the following command in the terminal:\n","\n","```py\n","pip install -U scikit-learn\n","```\n","\n","Now let's see how to implement the KNN algorithm:\n","\n","**Importing libraries**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"9d0f17f0","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d3e87b86","metadata":{},"source":["**Importing and loading the dataset**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ca2f71e1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["url = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data\"\n","\n","# Assign colum names to the dataset\n","names = ['sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width', 'Class']\n","\n","# Read dataset to pandas dataframe\n","dataset = pd.read_csv(url, names=names)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9fd366f8","metadata":{},"source":["**Looking at the first rows of the data**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"058c3171","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["dataset.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e3dae7c8","metadata":{},"source":["**Pre-processing**\n","\n","Split dataset into attributes and labels.
